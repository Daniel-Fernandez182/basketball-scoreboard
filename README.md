# Basketball Scoreboard

This is a website that mimics the mechanisms and display of a typical high school or college scoreboard. A few interactables on the webpage and a bit of javascript functionality as well as some simple design patterns to make the scoreboard look very similar to that of a real life basketball scoreboard.

Very simple website, though a good exercise of JavaScript, HTML, CSS. Feel free to check it out on my personal website.
